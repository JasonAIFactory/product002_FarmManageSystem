"""
Scheduled task: delete expired voice recordings from storage + database.

Voice recordings have a 30-day expires_at timestamp set during processing.
This task runs daily via Celery Beat to enforce the privacy retention policy.

Privacy protection: we only store audio temporarily for debugging.
After 30 days, the audio is deleted — only the text transcript remains.
