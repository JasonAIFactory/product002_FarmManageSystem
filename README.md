# BINJO - AI Farm Management Platform

**Full-stack farm management system** built for a solo apple orchard in South Korea. Voice-powered diary, receipt OCR bookkeeping, pesticide safety checks, direct-to-consumer orders, and government-compliant PDF export — all designed for use with work gloves on.

## Why This Exists

A friend runs a solo apple farm. His tools: a paper notebook, a calculator, and WhatsApp for orders. Every evening he spends 30+ minutes on paperwork instead of resting.

BINJO replaces that with: speak into your phone while walking the orchard → AI structures it into a farm diary, tracks expenses, and manages customer orders. **Zero typing required.**

## Key Features

### Voice Farm Diary
Record → Whisper STT → Claude parses structured data → farmer reviews → one-tap confirm.
Manual entry also supported with smart quick-tap buttons (8 common apple farming tasks).

### Receipt OCR Bookkeeping
Snap a photo of any receipt → Claude Vision extracts line items → auto-generates financial transactions → monthly P&L reports with charts.

### Pesticide Safety Engine
Select a pesticide → system calculates safe harvest date based on official Korean safety intervals. Warns before spray if harvest window is too close.

### Direct Orders & Payments
Consumer-facing brand page → product catalog → TossPayments checkout → order tracking → shipping management.

### Government PDF Export
One-click export of farm logs in the format required by Korean agricultural agencies (영농일지).

**Design Principle: Deterministic Backbone**
- Code handles: validation, auth, payments, data transforms, PDF generation
- AI handles: voice parsing, receipt OCR, agricultural term correction, insights
- Every AI call is behind a provider interface — swap Claude ↔ OpenAI without code changes

## Project Stats

- **130+ source files** across frontend and backend
- **7,000+ lines** of endpoint + page code
- **14 API endpoint modules** — auth, voice, farm logs, weather, fields, pesticides, receipts, transactions, reports, orders, payments, export, admin
- **9 farmer portal pages** — dashboard, record, logs, calendar, finance, fields, receipt, insights, login
- **4 development phases** completed in 4 weeks (solo developer)

---

## Local Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+, Python 3.11+, PostgreSQL (or Supabase account)

### Quick Start

```bash
# Frontend
cd binjo
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # Configure Supabase + API keys
npm run dev                   # → localhost:3000

# Backend
cd binjo-api
pip install -e .
cp .env.example .env          # Configure DB + AI API keys
alembic upgrade head          # Run migrations
uvicorn app.main:app --port 8002 --reload
```

Or with Docker:

```bash
docker compose up
# Frontend → localhost:3080
# Backend  → localhost:8082
```

## What I'd Do Differently (Honest Retrospective)

- **Photo upload is a two-step flow** (create log → upload photos). A single multipart request would be cleaner UX but would require refactoring the voice pipeline. Pragmatic trade-off for now.
- **No comprehensive test suite yet.** Prioritized shipping over coverage. Next step: pytest fixtures for the API + Playwright for critical paths.
- **JSONB for photo URLs** instead of a normalized table. Fine for 1-10 photos per log; would promote to a table if we needed per-photo metadata.
